19460,which is surrounded by an involucre composed of one or more rows of bracts. ,morphology
19461,There are 2 main types of floret: tubular (or disk) and ray (or ligulate). Tubular florets are regular and tube-shaped; a flower head entirely composed of this ,morphology

19463,single strap-like petal; a head entirely composed of this type of floret is called ,key
19464,"ligulate. When both forms of floret are present, the flower head is called radiate. In such cases, the tubular florets occupy the center (or disk) and the ray ",morphology
19465,florets form the margins. In ligulate and discoid flowers the florets are all perfect (having both pistil and stamens). In radiate flowers the tubular florets are ,morphology
19466,usually perfect and the ray florets are either female (pistil only) or neutral ,morphology
